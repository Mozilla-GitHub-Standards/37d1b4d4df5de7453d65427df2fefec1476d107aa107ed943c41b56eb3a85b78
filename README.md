Password Alets
-------------------------

This is the password alerts part of Privacy Watchdog. This add-on provides suggestions about how you use the passwords stored in your password manager more securely, for example by advising you to change your password on sites you visit frequently and use the same password on. It will also feature a password generator.

*NOTE* There is an experimental password generator in the works, however the generated passwords are *not* yet saved in the Firefox password manager. Please don't use this to generate passwords. This add-on is very much a work in progress, and shouldn't be used on your main Firefox profile.
